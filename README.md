# ✅ 2. Add a `.gitignore`

Create a file named `.gitignore` with this:



node_modules/
.env
.DS_Store


This keeps your repo clean.

---

# ✅ 3. Add License

Add a simple license file:

**LICENSE**



MIT License

Copyright (c) 2026 Dhanush

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, ...


This makes your repo open source and professional.

# 🚀 OPTIONAL: Set Up GitHub Pages

Since this is a frontend app, you can host it for FREE.

## 👉 Steps

1. Go to your **GitHub Repo**
2. Click **Settings**
3. Scroll to **GitHub Pages**
4. Select:
   - Source: **main**
   - Folder: **root**
5. Save

Within minutes, your app will be live at:



https://Dhanush-leet.github.io/Cafe-Vibe-Find-your-Perfect-Vibe/

# 🧠 NEXT – If You Want LIVE Deployment With API Proxy

Your app uses Nominatim/Overpass — direct API calls may break CORS on live hosts.

I’ll help you set up:

✅ Node.js proxy  
✅ Netlify Functions  
✅ Vercel Serverless API  
✅ Or a minimal Python Flask proxy

Just tell me which you prefer.
